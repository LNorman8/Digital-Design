# Exams

I make exam questions available on an individual basis. Ideally we could 
share exam questions and increase our mutual sets of questions.  That said,
I understand that faculty new to this course can struggle to put together 
all the needed resources to get a class running the first time.

You can make requests for exam questions by sending an email to:
