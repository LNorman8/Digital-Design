# Homework Solutions

I make homework solutions questions available on an individual basis. Ideally we could 
share homework questions so that I can incorperate them into the text.  That said,
I understand that faculty new to this course can struggle to put together 
all the needed resources to get a class running the first time.

You can make requests for homework solutions by sending an email to:
