If you are planning on performing a simulation of your design then the
top level entity should be a testbench. Inside the testbench should be
an instantiation of your design as the unit under test.

\begin{enumerate}
        \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
    \item
        Click on the Files tab in the \emph{Project Navigator} pane.
    \item
        Right click on \emph{topLevelProjectFile.v} in the \emph{Project
        Navigator} pane and select Set as Top-Level entity.
    \item
        Click on the Hierarchy tab in the \emph{Project Navigator} pane.
    \item
        In the main Quartus II window, click on \emph{Processing
        -\textgreater{} Start -\textgreater{} Start Analysis \& Elaboration.}
        This may take some time, so be patient.
    \item
        You can close the compilation report by clicking on the x in the red
        box,
    \item
        You should see \emph{topLevelProjectFile.v} as the root entity in the
        Hierarchy tab in the \emph{Project Navigator} pane.
    \item
        In the main Quartus II window, click \emph{Tools -\textgreater{} Run
        Simulation Tool -\textgreater{} RTL Simulation}. The ModelSim program
        will launch. This may take a few moments, be patient.
    \item
        In ModelSim, find the \emph{Library} pane. Expand the \emph{work}
        library by clicking on the ``+'' at left. Right click on
        \emph{topLevelProjectFile} and click \emph{Simulate}.
    \item
        In the sim pane, right mouse click on uut and select \emph{Add Wave}.

    \item
        Choose \emph{Simulate -\textgreater{} Run -\textgreater{} Run 100}.
        You should see inputs and output from \emph{topLevelProjectFile}.
    \item
        If you are asked to save the waveform. Perform the following steps:

        \begin{enumerate}
                \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
            \item
                Undock the Wave pane by clicking the undocking tool icon.

            \item
                Resize the undocked Wave window vertically by grabbing its top edge
                and dragging down. Make the window tall enough to fit all the waves
                with a little room to spare.

                \includegraphics{image3.png}

            \item
                Click the Zoom all tool to file the available horizontal space with
                the waveform.
            \item
                Re-order the waves so that the inputs are highest and outputs are
                lowest. Do this by grabbing their name and dragging it to the correct
                location.
            \item
                Color the intermediate signals (p1, p2, p4, p7) yellow by right
                clicking on them, selecting properties. In the View tab of the Wave
                Properties pop-up, click the Colors\ldots{} button for Wave Color and
                choose Yellow, click Close, then OK.
            \item
                Color the output signals red. Leave the input signals green.
            \item
                Click File -\textgreater{} Export -\textgreater{} Image
            \item
                Navigate to your project directory, provide a File name, then click
                Save
        \end{enumerate}

    \item
        Close ModelSim. Do not save wave commands.
\end{enumerate}
