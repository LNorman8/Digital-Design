Welcome to Introduction to Digital Design - A Datapath and Control Approach.  
You might be tempted to ask ``Why bother writing yet another digital design 
text?''  The assumption being that this text is going to cover the same ground as a 
typical digital design text.  And yes, to some  degree it will, but more importantly 
it will not.   \emph{This text presents a systematic approach to the design process for 
digital circuits that will enable you to design sophisticated digital systems.} I consider a
digital design sophisticated when it needs to be described algorithmically.

After going through this text and laboratories the goal is for you to be able to
use all of the material you learned to design a digital systems that in 
Figure~\ref{fig:introAbstract}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{An abstract digital system constructed from a datapath and a control unit.}
\label{fig:introAbstract}
\end{figure}

The datapath and control framework classifies the inputs and outputs of every
digital logic building block as either \textbf{Data inputs}, \textbf{Data output}, \textbf{Control inputs}, 
\textbf{Status output} (the two special signals, \textbf{clk} and \textbf{reset} sit outside this
classification).  Under this framework, the datapath performs all data manipulations and the 
control unit sequences the control inputs for datapath.  The datapath is built from
combinational and sequential building blocks like multiplexers and counters.  The control unit
is a finite state machine.

\subsection{Class Organization}
The text, homework and laboratory are intended for a 4-credit course.  The example timeline 
shown in Table~\ref{table:introTimeline} assumes 3 50-minute lectures per week and 
one 2 or 3 hour laboratory a week. 

\subsection{Laboratory}
While it is expected that students finish the laboratory
during the scheduled time, frequently students will need additional time to complete work, so accommodations need
to be in-place for them to access the hardware and software outside of course hours.   I expect that my students will 
need to work about 4-hours a week outside of class.

\subsection{Contributing to this work}
An important feature of this text is the ability for others to contribute to its ongoing improvement.
At present the text lacks HDL material and would benefit from a unit on FPGA architectures.  There
are countless ways that you can improve this text.  If you are interested in contributing, reach out 
to coulston@mines.edu and I can arrange to make a branch of the text repository.  I'd enjoy 
working with others and sharing perspectives.
