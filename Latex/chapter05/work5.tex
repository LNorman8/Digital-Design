\subsection{Helpful Stuff}

\textit{ When} the bit is stored.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Latches - a latch continuously samples its inputs.  Latches do not have
	a clock input.
	\item Clocked latches - a clocked latch samples its inputs when the clock input equals 1.
	When the clock input equals 0 the clocked latch does not change the currently stored bit.
	\item Flip flops - a flip flop samples its input when the its clock input rises.  The
	clock is said to rise when it goes from a logic 0 to a logic 1.
	When the clock input is not rising the flip flop does not change the currently stored bit.
\end{enumerate}
\textit{ How} the input(s) is transformed into a stored bit.
